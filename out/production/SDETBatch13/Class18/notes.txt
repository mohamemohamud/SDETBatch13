What is a Constructor in Java:
    A Constructor is a special block of code that helps us give initial values to the fields
    of a class. Initialization of object or instance.

Why we should use a constructor.
    1) When we use the constructor to initialize the object it looks more readable and cleaner.
    2) If the fields of a class are private it's not possible to access them outside a class without
    a constructor or method which means we can't initialize them without a method or a constructor.
    3) We can enforce rules like what kind of values are assigned to variables with the help of a
    constructor.
    4) If we want to make sure that some lines of code should always be executed when the object of a class
    is created we can put that code inside a constructor.

How to use Constructor.
    We create constructors inside the class and when an object of that class is created
    the constructor is executed automatically.

class Car{
String make;
String model;

Car( String carMake,String carModel){
make=carMake;
model=carModel;

}
public static void main(String[] args){
Car bmw= new Car("BMW","m4");
}
}

Rules that we have to follow if we plan on using Constructor:
    1) Constructors don't have return types not even void.
    2)The name of the constructor should always be same as name of the class
    3) Constructors can't be created with static keyword.
    4) We can use any access modifiers with Constructor.
    5)If we don't create a constructor in a class a default constructor with zero parameters(nothing in () )
    is created by compiler(Takes the code written by us, and it converts that code by byte code which is easier
    for java to understand).
    6) It is not allowed to have two constructors in a class with same number of parameters and same type

this. keyword:
    We can use the "this" keyword to access the instance variables when you have same name variables in
    your method or constructor or any block of code.

this(): not that common
    Calls the constructors of a class inside other constructors.
    why we should use because it helps us reuse already written constructors if they contain same code
    why we want multiple constructors on the first place because we want gibe end user flexibility
    that we can create the objects of our class in many ways.
