How to change theme:
    double click on the shift button twice inside the pop up type theme and hit enter.
    After that you will see the options to change the theme.
What is a method:
     Method in java is a block of code(group of java statements). It defines the behaviors
     of a class.

Why should we use methods:
    1) It helps us remove the duplicate code from our application. We just create a method and
    everytime we need that logic we just call the method that contains the logic.
    2) It also allows to write the code in the form of modules which makes the development of large
    applications easier.

How to use Methods:
    1) First we create the method inside a class.
    2) We create the object of that class.
    3) we call the method by writing the name of the object than a dot than name of the method

  Example:
class Calculator {

void add(int x, int y) {
System.out.println(x+y)
}

public static void main(String[] args){
Calculator calculator=new Calculator();
calculator.add(10,20);
}
}

Rules to create and use methods:

void add(int x, int y) {
System.out.println(x+y)
}
    void=> void is a return type and it is a must, if you want to return a specific date type write the name of that
    data type like for int we write int for String we write String if we don't want to return anything we write void.
    when we write a void we can't assign a method to a variable

    add => next we write the name of the method which can be anything but it should follow the rules for giving name to
    to a variable(ex. can't start with number or @$@#)

    ()=> We specify the parameters here we can pass any date type inside these parenthesis
         They are optional we can leave them empty
{
System.out.println(x+y)
}
The body of the method that contains java statements

    add(int x,int y) => This part with the same of the method and its parameters is called signture of method



Types of Variables in Java:
    There are 3 types of variable 1) local 2) instance 3) static

    1) Local variable :

    if a variable is inside a method || a part of its parameters || or a loop || switch statement ||
    if else condition, it is called a local variable.

    2) Instance variable:

       If a variable is inside the class but outside of any block of code like method loop
       switch statement if else condition it is called an instance variable.

    3)static variable:

    If an instance variable has a static keyword with it than it is called a static variable

Why learn about different types of variables??
   1) because it helps us reduce the amount of RAM that our application will be using when it will be running.
   2) with the help of these variables we can pass information between methods of class.
   3) local variables occupy the memory for the shortest period of time as soon as your method is done executing they
   are destroyed by a special program called garbage collector

How to use these:
    Local: create inside block code

Pro VS Cons

Local Variables:
Advantages:  They occupy the memory for the shortest period of time. Always try to use local variables when possible to save
       memory.

Disadvantages:  They are very limited in scope which means we can't access them outside of method or that block or code.

Instance variables:
Advantages:
       They have broader scope as compared to local variables means we can access in all the methods of that class
Disadvantages:
       They occupy the space in your RAM (memory) for longer periods of time.
Static variables:
Advantages:
        We can call static variables without creating an object of a class.
        We can share a single variables between all the objects of a class.
