There are three types of variables in java local instance static.
Local variables:
    Are the variables which are created inside a block of code like method,
    loop switch statement if else condition or a constructor.


Advantages:
    We should always prefer local variables to instance or static variables over instance or static
    variables because they live for shortest period of time inside your RAM.
Disadvantages:
    They can't be accessed
